The `placeholderImage` directive creates client-side placeholder images in any
size. The directive creates a PNG image using the HTML5 canvas library and
uses the generated client-side URL as the `src` on an `img` element.

The directive takes a single eponymous attribute that specifies the dimensions
of the image to create; the expected format is "100x100".
