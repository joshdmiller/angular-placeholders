The `placeholderText` directive dynamically inserts "Lorem ipsum"-style text
into an element. It can work as either an element or an attribute. 

`placeholderText` accepts two optional attributes: `num-sentences` and
`num-paragraphs`. If `num-sentences` is provided, the body of the element will
be replaced with the specified number of sentences. `num-paragraphs` will
replace the body of the element with the specified number of `<p>` tags
containing random sentences. 

The default behavior is a random number of paragraphs.
